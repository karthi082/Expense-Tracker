The Expense Tracker is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to track their income and expenses. Users can add transactions with descriptions and amounts, and the app automatically calculates the balance. Transactions are displayed in a list, with income shown in green and expenses in red. The balance is updated in real-time as transactions are added.
